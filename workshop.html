                            <p>As the volume of information available to science increases, adoption and development of new techniques for processing this data is essential. In order to better understand the opportunities machine learning could offer data-intensive researchers, we are running a 3-day workshop that will provide introductory sessions on data exploration, a diverse range of speakers from academia and industry and networking opportunities to meet with other data-intensive researchers and professionals. Our focus for the 3 days is exploring recent advances in machine learning from fields outside astronomy and develop a better understanding of where these techniques may be best applied in our research. We encourage participants with different backgrounds and levels of experience with machine learning as the workshop will offer sessions for novices through to advanced users.</p>

A Robot Scientist is a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from AI to execute cycles of automated scientific experimentation: hypothesis formation, selection of efficient experiments to discriminate between hypotheses, execution of experiments using laboratory automation equipment, and analysis of results. The motivation for Robot Scientists is to both to better understand science, and to make science more efficient. Our Robot Scientist â€˜Adamâ€™ was the first machine to autonomously discover novel scientific knowledge.Â  Our Robot ScientistÂ  â€˜Eveâ€™ was originally designed to automate drug discovery, with a focus on neglected tropical diseases. In chess there is a continuum of ability from novices up to Grandmasters. We argue that this is true in science as well, from the simple research that Adam and Eve can do, up to an Einstein or Newton.Â  If this is true then it is likely that advances in AI and lab automation will drive the development of ever-smarter Robot Scientists. The Physics Nobel Frank Wilczek is on record as saying (10 years ago) that in 100 yearsâ€™ time the best physicist will be a machine. If this comes to pass this will not only transform technology, but our understanding of science, and the Universe.

Such approaches have the potential to revolutionise mental health assessment, if their development and evaluation follows a real world deployment setting.In this talk, we will provide an overview on the field and our work, in two parts. In the first part, we will present the first study to combine textual data from social media (i.e., posts and messages) and logs from smart devices to assess an individual's mental health. In particular, we will present a multiple kernel learning approach that leverages such heterogeneous data for assessing an individual's mental health over time, with very high accuracy. In the second part of the talk, we will take a closer look on the ability of such approaches be employed under a real-world setting. Using extensive experimentation and evaluation of current state-of-the-art approaches, we will outline major open challenges in the field and provide directions for future research.

In this context, machine learning has a significant role to play in extracting the most relevant patterns and relationships in the data. In my talk, I will discuss the benefits of a data-driven approach to the design of meta-heuristic optimisers, providing examples in applications ranging from data clustering, over planning problems, to structure prediction.</td>

Many data scientists are trained to develop machine learning models, but how can these seamlessly be integrated into the rest of the production technology stack and what pain points can this bring? Despite developing a range of in-house capabilities, processes and practices in order to tackle this problem itâ€™s not always smooth sailing! Pitfalls such as internal schema development, package management, and testing can all leave you wondering why you wanted to deploy your model in the first place! Weâ€™ll discuss how to get started with deploying a machine learning model, considerations around the practicalities of the build and how to bridge gaps between a technical teamâ€™s skill sets to enable data products in production.</td>
